# Break
 Engage Break hack. Installation is simple, just #include Installer.event in your buildfile.
 Credit to Pikmin1211 as this was adapted from a Bells of Byelen skill he created.
 Tested with Skillsys, may not work without it. A good number of functions are hooked
 to account for Break, so it may not be compatible with some other hacks.
